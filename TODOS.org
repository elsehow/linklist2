# minidux can do this with createStore(reuder, initial, *enhancer*)
*** Join attempts with bad stuff shouldn't need server
*** Post attempts
** Can't replicate from remote unless joined room
** Catch around all validation stuff - returns unexpected errors
* Refactors
** Make validator export error messages - import them from the tests
** DONE More DRY websocket client routes

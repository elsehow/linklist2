* UI Details

css
 big white font
 big bar on top
 small gray sender / time

* Nice-to-haves
** Safety
*** Sanitize html (and test)
*** Retry 'stateReducer' test
# start with the initial state
# after each actions, describe ONLY the expected updates
# e.g., replace `state:` with `step:` or `reduceStep:`
*** Return errors from server `db.post` call
*** Send/join disabled if !connected 
** Performance
*** Hyperxify (if using hyperx)
*** Performance tricks on pathological #s of posts
*** Validate stuff on the client-side
# minidux can do this with createStore(reuder, initial, *enhancer*)
**** Join attempts with bad stuff shouldn't need server
**** Post attempts
** UI
*** Spinners
loading spinner,
put it on ALL buttons when waiting
*** Embeddables
**** Images
**** Youtube videos
**** Soundcloud
*** Remember psuedonym in local storage
# Load pseudonym from local storage, use to emit join message?
*** Unread status
**** Thicker bar on unread messages
*** Favicon
**** Online
**** Offline
**** Online & unread messages
* Refactors
** DONE Make validator export error messages - import them from the tests
CLOSED: [2017-08-26 Sat 22:11]
** DONE More DRY websocket client routes
CLOSED: [2017-08-25 Fri 14:13]
** DONE Break out validation in server.js to validation.js
CLOSED: [2017-08-26 Sat 22:11]
** Integration test could be more DRY, concise
